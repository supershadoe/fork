### fork

This is an in-development app to let some apps use mobile data always regardless
of being connected to a WiFi network â€”- to use sites blocked by firewalls in a 
restricted network.

This app is intended for devices which don't have a "Mobile data only apps"
setting like Samsung.

Uses Compose for UI and Android's VPN service for the split-tunneling
functionality.

Although this app doesn't need root to run, you can't run this app simultaneously with another VPN app.
